#Personal Website

> This repo hosts the source code of my personal website.

## Warning
The code is public so that I can benefit from free code analysis, CI and deployment tools, and to allow you to see its internal structure. But **you cannot run this website locally**. This is to keep my dev environment clean ! :)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
